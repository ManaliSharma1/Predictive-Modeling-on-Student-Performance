# Predictive Modeling on Student Performance

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building **predictive models** to analyze and predict a student’s **math performance** using demographic and academic features.
The task was completed as part of my **Data Science Internship**, emphasizing end-to-end supervised learning.

## Objective

To predict a student’s math score (and pass/fail outcome) using features such as:

* Gender
* Race/Ethnicity
* Parental Level of Education
* Lunch Type
* Test Preparation Course
* Reading & Writing Scores

## Dataset

* **Source:** Kaggle – *Students Performance in Exams*
* **Size:** 1000 records
* **Target Variable:** Math Score

## Models Implemented

* **Logistic Regression** (Binary Classification: Pass/Fail)
* **Decision Tree Regressor**
* **Random Forest Regressor**

### Key Results

| Model               | Accuracy | F1 Score |
| ------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Logistic Regression | ~90%     | ~0.94    |
| Decision Tree       | ~89%     | ~0.93    |
| Random Forest       | ~89%     | ~0.93    |

## Conclusion

Predictive modeling can effectively analyze student academic performance.
Among the tested models, **Logistic Regression** was the most suitable, and **academic scores** were the strongest predictors of math performance.
